## WeatherPy Analysis
The analysis of the weather data by latitude using the OpenWeatherMap API has the following observerable trends.
  
###### 1 Warmer At Equator
The temperatures becomes warmer as the city is located closure to the equator (0 Latitude) and colder the 
futher away from the equator (Figure 1).
  
###### 2 No impact on Cloudiness 
There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness (Figure 3).

###### 3 No impact on Wind Speed
There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed (Figure 4).

  
## Results
Outlined below are the results of the analysis of the OpenWeatherMap API.
